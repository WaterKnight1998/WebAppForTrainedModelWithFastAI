# Web App for detecting Iron Man, Captain America and Thanos from a given image.

The sample app described here is up at https://marvelsuperheroesimagerecognition.onrender.com/. Test it out with Super Heroes images!

This WebApp is based on the guide for production deployment at Render, can be found at next link https://course.fast.ai/deployment_render.html.

I've changed htmls, the model and make it a PWA (Progressive Web App). It can be installed in Android. If you open the website in Chrome and press "Add to home screen", it'will get installed. 

It has been made for the deliverable 3 of Artificial Intelligence of the University of La Rioja (https://github.com/IA1819)

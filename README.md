# Web App for detecting Iron Man, Captain America and Thanos from a given image.

The sample app described here is up at https://marvelsuperheroesimagerecognition.onrender.com/. Test it out with Super Heroes images!

This WebApp is based on the guide for production deployment at Render, can be found at next link https://course.fast.ai/deployment_render.html.

I've changed htmls, the model and make it a PWA (Progressive Web App). It can be installed if you open it in Chrome and press "Add to home screen". 

It has been made for the deliverable 3 of Artificial Intelligence of the University of La Rioja (https://github.com/IA1819)
